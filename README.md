simple description about myself whilst familiarizing with GitHub

## Current
I am a senior working on B.S. in Cybersecurity. I am about to graduate in December 2021.

## Background
I am from Malaysia, a multicultural country. I like to play sports for my leisure, though I am mostly listening to podcast/music or watching dramas/videos, slowly I become a potato couch. (p.s. Sports require some amount of people but everyone is busy... sad) 

## Plans
Junior level penetration tester/security analyst are among my main goals after graduation, but software engineering and data analyst are welcomed. 
Aside of job, I hope to keep a balanced in between exercise and work.
